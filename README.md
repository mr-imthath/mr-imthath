## Objective

Highly motivated and self-taught cybersecurity professional with over 1 year of hands-on experience in security operations and blue team environments. Skilled in SIEM monitoring, Threat detection, Threat intelligence and incident response using tools like Wazuh, Splunk, and Suricata. Proficient in log analysis, Security monitoring and governance, EDR/XDR, and vulnerability management. Familiar with industry frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and NIST. Passionate about reducing cyber risk through proactive monitoring, security automation, and Eager to contribute to a 24/7 SOC team and protect critical infrastructure from evolving threats. 

## üë®‚Äçüíª Cybersecurity Projects:

- **Windows Event Log Monitoring & Threat Detection Lab**

  This project simulates adversary behavior in a Windows 10 lab to generate and analyze Windows Event Logs. It leverages Sysmon, PowerShell, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework to build detection rules and playbooks for real-world incident response scenarios.

  - [Windows Threat Detection Lab](https://github.com/mr-imthath/Windows-Threat-Detection-Lab/blob/main/README.md)
 
- **Simulated SOC Home Lab for Threat Detection and Incident Response**
  ‚Ä¢	Built and configured a virtual SOC lab environment in VirtualBox using Windows 10, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, and intentionally vulnerable machines to simulate real-world enterprise infrastructure for hands-on offensive and defensive security practice.
  ‚Ä¢	Deployed and integrated Splunk and Wazuh for centralized log collection, SIEM correlation, and real-time threat detection.
  ‚Ä¢	Conducted adversary simulations using Kali Linux tools, including credential dumping (Mimikatz), network scanning (Nmap), and malicious PowerShell execution (Metasploit), and validated detections using Sysmon logs and MITRE ATT&CK mappings.
  ‚Ä¢	Created detection rules, triaged alerts, and performed log analysis and incident response, emulating Tier 1 SOC Analyst responsibilities.
